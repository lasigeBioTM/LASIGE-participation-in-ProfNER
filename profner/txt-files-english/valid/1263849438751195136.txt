How cool to go bar-hopping eh?
- if you sit down without being disinfected beforehand, you can become infected.
- if they disinfect the table but not the chairs, ditto. 
- if they bring you the glasses caught x where you put your mouth, ditto. 
THE VIRUS IS STILL HERE.
What has changed is that you would have a hospital bed.
