Hello, my friends!

If the Alarma lasts 40 years and you are shot if you protest, it IS called a dictatorship.

If it lasts 2 months, it's because of a pandemic, it's voted by Congress and you can act like an asshole shouting freedom in the street, it's NOT called a dictatorship.

It's easy, even Abascal could understand it! https://t.co/MqzNgcsJPX
