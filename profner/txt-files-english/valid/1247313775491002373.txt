"Plataforma de afectados por el Covid-19" (Platform of people affected by Covid-19). This is the name of the new business of Judge Serrano (Vox). Four years ago he set up another one and falsified its capital to obtain 2.5 million of public money. Now the Treasury is claiming all the money and the Prosecutor's Office is investigating him. https://t.co/idpJ8roFRf
