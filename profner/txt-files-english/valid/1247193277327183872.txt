This nymph has not respected the confinement, yesterday she left her house and perched on a balcony of Paseo Juan Carlos I in Las Delicias.
I'm sure its owner would love to get it back, @PoliciaVLL has the details of the person who has custody of it.
Give RT to see if it reaches him! https://t.co/SDvl8uuEeD
