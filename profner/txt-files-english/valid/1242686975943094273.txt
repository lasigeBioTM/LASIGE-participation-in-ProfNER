I am not happy about anyone's death, but is it Marlaska's mission to lament the death of a prisoner from a coronavirus and praise the prison population?
Have you also named and honored the memory of the civil guardsmen killed by Covid-19?
I no longer understand anything about this government. https://t.co/oEtlTtfBlQ
