Today when I went to Lidl (Sweden) with mask and gloves the same thing happened to me as always, the guy in the back didn't keep his distance. I told him to move, he did but not enough, called me a clown and sent me back to my country. guess what happened? I got kicked out of Lidl. https://t.co/nO4NmxhlAy
