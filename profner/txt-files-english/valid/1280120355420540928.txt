Now I find out that RTVE, which did broadcast George Floyd's funeral, is not going to broadcast the funeral of those who died of coronavirus. And that Pedro SÃ¡nchez is not going to attend because he has taken it upon himself to organize something in Portugal. Seriously, this government is so, so miserable....
