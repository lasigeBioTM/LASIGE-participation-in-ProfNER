Monday funeral in the Almudena for the victims of the Covid 19.

The King and Queen of Spain and religious authorities of other denominations will attend.

Not Sanchez. He is going to Lisbon to spend the day as he has Falcon monkey.

Better to eat cod in Lisbon than to pay homage to the victims, of course.
