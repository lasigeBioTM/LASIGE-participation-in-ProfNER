There is no way to catch it:

"live quite a long time of their lives with severe sequelae" NO ONE KNOWS. It was only a few months ago that the fucking virus was detected.

"There will be no vaccine" "we are not going to get out of this" emm, yes. 

"We have failed as a society." 
Now it is society that is to blame.
