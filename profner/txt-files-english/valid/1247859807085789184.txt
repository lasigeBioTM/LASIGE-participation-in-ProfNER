@lorenzoamor_ata In my case, I have unsubscribed from the Aut√≥nomo and I have requested the cessation of activity alleging major cause Coronavirus Pandemic and they tell me that this is not a reason for them to approve my unemployment of self-employed. Is it real? Can anyone help me? A pandemic is not force majeure? Thank you.
