@Juanmi_News Los Cayetanos de Núñez de Balboa in the neighborhood of Salamanca and Aravaca. They jump the confinement without keeping the safety distance skipping all the rules. The police do not even show up. If this same thing happens in Vallecas or Orcasitas, they would be beaten to a pulp and arrested. #Cacerolada21h https://t.co/IPVDJQR4FA
