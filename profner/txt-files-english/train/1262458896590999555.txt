Covid19 is a very rare virus. 
In the 8M demonstrations, it is not contagious. 
At the closing of IFEMA, it is contagious. 
In the tributes to ETA members, it is not contagious. 
In the Núñez de Balboa demonstrations, it is contagious. 
At Anguita's funeral, he doesn't spread...

How the fucker mutates!
