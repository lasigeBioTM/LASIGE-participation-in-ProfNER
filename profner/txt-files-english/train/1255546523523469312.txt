You can't take the dog out in the field because the timber says so. If you dare to go to the officer, you will be fined. There are no parks in the neighborhood, I guess they want them to shit on the sidewalks.
Long live our heroes, who are putting an end to the virus with fines! What an exquisite treatment!
