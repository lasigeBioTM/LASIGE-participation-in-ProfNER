Confined I thought of all the plans I would make when I got out, the people I wanted to see, the paintings I wanted to revisit, the trips I wanted to take, and I made a poem out of it....
Now the poem has been made into an ad that can already be seen on TV.

I hope it excites you. https://t.co/SuDuRnNO7T
