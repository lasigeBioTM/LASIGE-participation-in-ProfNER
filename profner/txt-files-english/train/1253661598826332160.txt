This guy is the head of Opinion of EL MUNDO, the same newspaper that houses a convicted for inventing interviews or that published on its front page the photo of an immigrant suffocated by the virus. He is Tertuliano of La Sexta. Full of philias and phobias and bullying. Decide if you give him a chance https://t.co/KtSTt12u8e
