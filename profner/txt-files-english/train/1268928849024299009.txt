My father has a carpentry shop in Lucena, he makes very nice furniture with pine wood but with the crisis in the sector and the COVID-19 there is hardly any work.
We want to make known the family carpentry, it is our illusion, twitter please do your magic. 

Dissemination is appreciated🙏🏼 https://t.co/382IsfgQCN
