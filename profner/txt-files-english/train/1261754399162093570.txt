@JulitroOliva @_MM_Lopez_ @Isthar6680 @JuanfraEscudero Ingenious! We're going to have to live with the virus, it's going to stay for a long time and the vaccine minimum will take a year. The "new normal" will have to include masks, gloves, screens, social distance. But we cannot be without activating the economy until there is a vaccine.
