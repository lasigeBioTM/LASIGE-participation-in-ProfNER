SARS-CoV-2 is a Class 3 pathogen. My opinion, is that you have to "protect yourself" AS IF IT WAS EVEN Class 4, because, one thing is the low lethality with respect to viruses like Ebola and quite another is that it is much more infective, with an R of almost 6. @DePeaPaRNE @rne ðŸ‘‡ https://t.co/oSwphEgLV5
