@PoliciaLPA Yesterday I wrote the diary of 1 neighbor who has made the confinement 1 real nightmare, especially those of us who are essential.well today adds to what yesterday, making and receiving visits without precaution or measures. Thank you for going to those who call them and go to the police station (irony).
