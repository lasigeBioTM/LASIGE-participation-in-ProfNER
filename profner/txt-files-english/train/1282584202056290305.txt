@Carol_Raval @rafapal Is the thing about the very dangerous covid leaking through the air a great scientific discovery too? (as a rare thing)
What about the fact that autopsies have not been performed on all those who died from covid?
80 previous pathologies but the cause of death is covid, it is also a scientific idea.
