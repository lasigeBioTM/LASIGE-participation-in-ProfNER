@madridista73hlm @VonBingen2 @AlexandraJAlva4 Well I think we are falling into their trap. They ask us to prove that there is no virus, to explain why there are so many deaths and contagions. The basis of it all is that it is science that has to prove that the virus exists. You do it and they call you a denialist.
