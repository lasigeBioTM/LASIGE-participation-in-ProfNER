@Bravo199285 @Telegrafia02 There are people who comment that this vaccine is bad for them..I've been getting the flu vaccine for more than 8 years.before it was always very complicated with throat and ear infection..I had to take antibiotics..no longer...I get it much more lax and if anything some paracetamol. ðŸ‘©ðŸ’»
