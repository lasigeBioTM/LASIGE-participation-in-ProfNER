A victim of covid19 breaks down in tears at the sight of protesters in the streets. "I have been admitted to IFEMA 22 days and almost died 3 times. My wife I didn't see her when she was admitted. I have not been able to say goodbye to her. They have taken her to be cremated in Huelva".
This is terrible. https://t.co/7wE6KcOlSG
