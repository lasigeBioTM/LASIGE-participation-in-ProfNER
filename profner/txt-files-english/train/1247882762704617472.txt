I speak on the phone with PÃ©rez-Reverte and he says: "Yesterday I challenged 164 harassers to a duel to the death. At 12:00 in Plaza de EspaÃ±a. None of them showed up. The confinement, they said. Cowards. I retaliated by whipping them with the whip of the blockade".

Then he passes me his phone book ðŸ‘‡.
