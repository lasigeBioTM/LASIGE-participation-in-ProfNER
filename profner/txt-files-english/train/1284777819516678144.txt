28 years old, do not smoke, do not drink alcohol frequently, swimming 5/7 days a week and in general all my life. Post Covid I have hypertension, tachycardia, chest pain and dyspnea on moderate exertion. 
All I can say is, don't get complacent just because of your age. Keep taking care of yourselves
