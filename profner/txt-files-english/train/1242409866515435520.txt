@FeGarPe79 @escipion_r @LuciaMendezEM You are VERY wrong,supporting this government that leaves sanitary material stuck in borders and that does not buy the necessary medicine to fight the coronavirus is what will lead toðŸ‡ªa loss of 1 whole generation.Unable to see it until it touches you closely,like Miguel BosÃ©.
