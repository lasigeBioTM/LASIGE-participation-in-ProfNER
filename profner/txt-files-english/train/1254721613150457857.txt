How ironic it is to go out on my street with a mask to take the dog out and see it full of children skating or riding their bikes and their parents, more importantly WITH the helmet but WITHOUT the mask then you can go out and clap your hands at 20:00 or if you get a bug you can demand attention at the hospital.
