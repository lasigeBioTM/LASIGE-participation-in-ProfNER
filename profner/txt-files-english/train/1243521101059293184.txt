@Aspirar_al_uno Yesterday I finished the Gata Cattana poetry book and today I start Dora Bruder for @LecturasShoa (social life and club meetings are suspended) but confined life with readings tastes a bit more like life and less like confinement. I don't know if Dora Bruder will achieve that goal, though.
