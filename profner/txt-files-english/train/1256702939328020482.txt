It is not clear to me whether the anti-Sanchist resistance wants to eliminate the confinement or to make it more extreme. I hope that Casado is clear about it and does not pay any attention to the environment or to the troop of exalted people. It is one thing to criticize SÃ¡nchez and another to make a fool of himself.
