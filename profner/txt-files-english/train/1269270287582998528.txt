This is my niece Angela. She finished her nursing degree this September. In March she went to Madrid to lead the battle against the coronavirus. She has just arrived home and here we are welcoming her as a heroine. If you want I can pass on your applause. She is 22 years old. https://t.co/8SpqsptznV
