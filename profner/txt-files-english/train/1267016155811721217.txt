Victoria, here photographed with two of the four galgos of her deceased father from COVID that SOS Galgos will be receiving these days. These two in particular are 5 year old siblings. They are called Chunga (what a shame of a name) and Pitufo and we are excited to meet them tomorrow!!!! https://t.co/87kzRH5EI2
