@m_madbap @narfss @migarte78 @Panik81 Surely we didn't know how the virus worked?
With China building 2 hospitals in 20 days, with Italy confined.
When the government received recommendations from the WHO not to hold mass events, but we encouraged to go to the 8 M, didn't we?
The science said so, the government did not.
