Barber's Adagio for strings always reminded me of Platoon or The Elephant Man. Not anymore.
Since the confinement began, in addition to the applause, every day, someone in my area plays one minute of the Adagio at 12h. Without fail. 
I don't know who it is or why, but I love it. https://t.co/86MfuugSkD
