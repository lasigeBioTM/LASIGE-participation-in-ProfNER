Just like what I discuss with my friends. Those who grumble to see people in the street, what are they waiting for? To stay at home until 2022 when the vaccine appears, if it does? To starve to death instead of COVID? Economy stopped for a year? The virus is not going to disappear, we have to make it sustainable.
