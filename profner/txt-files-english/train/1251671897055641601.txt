Teófilo and Mercedes. 93 and 88 years old. Both bilateral pneumonia caused by #COVID19. Almost two weeks in hospital. There have been days when they could not see the light at the end of the black tunnel. They got through it together, as they have done everything for 70 years. They are my grandparents and they are coming home today 👏👏 https://t.co/YcYEHCV0It
