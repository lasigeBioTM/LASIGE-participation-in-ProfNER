One question: Can you break the confinement leaving Madrid and go to Meneses de Campos in Palencia?
This guy did it yesterday, taking pictures and went to his grandfather's village.
The confinement is for all Spaniards and a lot of Spaniards: Aznar, Rajoy, Fra-Casado, BRIBONES. https://t.co/uMs1Htrfdw
