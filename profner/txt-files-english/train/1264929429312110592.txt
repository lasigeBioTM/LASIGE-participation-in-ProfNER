I receive the news that on Thursday a 16 year old former student of mine whose father died in March from #COVIDãƒ¼19 committed suicide.
The telephone psychology was not enough and he decided to leave.
The mother abandoned them at the age of 9 and returned to her England.
No siblings, no relatives
Why?
