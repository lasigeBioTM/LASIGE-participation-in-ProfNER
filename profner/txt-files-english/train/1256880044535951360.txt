Mothers who were daughters and granddaughters. May the loneliness in times #COVID19 be fleeting and its passing bring the strongest hugs. May we never again forget that their immense effort, their life stories, their strength, is our legacy and a treasure we must protect. #HappyMotherDay ❤️ https://t.co/BfoKXmg9cN
