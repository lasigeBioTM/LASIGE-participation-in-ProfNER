Today is the #DiaInternacionalDeLaDanza and from the #GobCan we launch this piece with some of the great figures we have in the Canary Islands. 

Recorded from the confinement, you will be able to see it on the #TeatroGuiniguada networks and on @RTVCes(23:30h) within a special program. #DID20 https://t.co/NBkFlUchFs
