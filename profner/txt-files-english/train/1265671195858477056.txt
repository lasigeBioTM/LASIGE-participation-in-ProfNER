Every day in @comunidadmadrid we keep a minute of silence for the victims of #Covid19. 

Today, the first day of national mourning, the entire regional government has celebrated together.

Every morning more and more citizens join this special moment ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ Thank you for coming. https://t.co/xKoJtMjFur
