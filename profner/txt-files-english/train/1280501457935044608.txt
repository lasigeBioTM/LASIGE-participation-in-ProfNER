The @ComunidadMadrid will have this fall the first pandemic hospital next to an airport in the world, fruit of the experience of the fight against #COVID19. 

Prepared for epidemics, catastrophes... 1,000 beds, 50 ICUs and the latest technology.

Madrid always at the forefront. https://t.co/ecN1Ecsa4G
